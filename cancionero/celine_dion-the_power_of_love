SPERS IN THE MORNING
OF LOVERS SLEEPING TIGHT
ARE ROLLING LIKE THUNDER NOW
AS I LOOK IN YOUR EYES

I HOLD ON TO YOUR BODY
AND FEEL EACH MOVE YOU MAKE
YOUR VOICE IS WARM AND TENDER
A LOVE THAT I COULD NOT FORSAKE

(FIRST CHORUS)
CAUSE I AM YOUR LADY
AND YOU ARE MY MAN
WHENEVER YOU REACH FOR ME
ILL DO ALL THAT I CAN
